# Patient Form

A Patient Form created using Windows Forms with C#. 

The program features a GUI where the user can input Patient Information such as Patient ID and Last Name to view information about patients. The patient information is grabbed from a Microsoft Access Database. As users input information, they can see a preview of Patients information based on what they enter.

The second form displays a large amount of medical data on the patient. The user is given the option to load another patient or add, remove, or update existing patients.

This project was originally completed in Fall 2020 during my Sophomore year of my IT Degree.
